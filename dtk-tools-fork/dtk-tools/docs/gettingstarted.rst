Pre-requisites
``````````````

In order to use the tools, you will need a x64 version of Python 3.6. To verify which Python is installed on your computer, issue a: `python` and the output should look like::

    Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5, Mar 21 2017, 18:41:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

Then you will need to clone the dtk-tools repository. ::

    git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/dtk-tools.git

Windows installation
````````````````````

On Windows, navigate to the dtk-tools directory and issue a ::

    python setup.py

All the Python dependencies along with the package will be installed on your machine.

To finish, in order to use dtk-tools from everywhere on your system, ddd the path to the dtk_tools folder to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

CentOS 7 installation
`````````````````````
Note: This install guide assumes you are running CentOS 7.
Also it assumes you have a desktop environment (pyCOMPS require a display in order to allow COMPS login box to appear).

Installation of Python 3.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the system and download some pre-requisites::

    yum update -y
    yum install yum-utils -y
    yum groupinstall development -y
    yum install snappy-devel -y
    yum install openssl-devel -y

Install Python::

    yum install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
    yum install python36u

Make sure Python is installed by issuing a::

    python3.6 -V

Install pip and other dev packages::

    yum install python36u-pip
    yum install python36u-devel
    yum install python36u-tkinter

Create a virtual environment::

    python3.6 -m venv idm

Activate the idm environment::

    source idm/bin/activate

Installation of dtk-tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/dtk-tools.git

Install the tools::

    cd dtk-tools
    python setup.py

Download and install pyCOMPS::

    curl -O https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/PythonDependencies/pyCOMPS-2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    pip install pyCOMPS-2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl

MAC OSX installation
````````````````````
Tested with MacOS High Sierra

Make sure you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed::

    xcode-select --install

Install Python 3.6 x64 from the `Official Python Website <http://python.org/>`_.

Install the virtualenv package allowing to create virtual environments::

    pip3 install virtualenv

Then navigate inside the `dtk-tools` directory and create an IDM virtual environment::

    virtualenv idm

Activate the virtual environment (you will have to do activate the virtual environment first before using dtk-tools)::

    source ./idm/bin/activate

Make sure you are in the virtual environment by checking if the prompt displays `(idm)` at the beginning as shown::

    (idm) my-computer:dtk-tools

Download and install pyCOMPS::

    curl -O https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/PythonDependencies/pyCOMPS-2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    pip3 install pyCOMPS-2.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Download and install catalyst::

    curl -O https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/PythonDependencies/catalyst_report-1.0.3-py3-none-any.whl
    pip3 install catalyst_report-1.0.3-py3-none-any.whl

Navigate inside the `dtk-tools` folder and install dtk-tools::

    python setup.py

Testing your installation
-------------------------
To ensure your installation is working properly, you can issue a::

    dtk version

Which should display::

    ____    ______  __  __          ______                ___
    /\  _`\ /\__  _\/\ \/\ \        /\__  _\              /\_ \

        \/___/    \/_/  \/_/\/_/          \/_/\/___/  \/___/ \/____/\/___/
    Version: 1.0b3

You can also follow the recipe about :doc:`cookbook/firstsimulation`.

Configuration of the tools
--------------------------

To configure your user-specific paths and settings for local and HPC job submission, edit the properties in ``simtools/simtools.ini``.
To learn more about the available options, please refer to :doc:`simtools/simtoolsini`.

One can verify the proper system setup by navigating to the ``test`` directory and running the unit tests contained therein, e.g. by executing ``nosetests`` if one has the `nose <http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ package installed.
