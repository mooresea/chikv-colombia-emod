Introduction
============

The dtk-tools suite is intended to strengthen and simplify the interaction between researchers and the DTK model.

Modules contained in this suite of tools are intended to:

- Empower the user to configure diverse simulations and arbitrarily complex campaigns built up from a standardized library of configuration fragments and utility functions
- Facilitate transparent switching between local and remote HPC commissioning, job-status queries, and output analysis
- Enable the configuration of arbitrary collections of simulations (e.g. parameteric sweeps) through an extensible library of builder classes;
- Collect a library of post-processing analysis functionality, e.g. filtering, mapping, averaging, plotting.
