	Generate a small world networx graph on a 2d grid:
	- assume nodes occupy a subset of points on a regular square 2d grid
	- assume adjacency_list is provided specifying the *local* grid connections of nodes; the long range links will be automatically added
	
	Notes: we let the user specify their own local neighborhood per node instead of using related networkx graph implementations   
	- the networkx implementation of small-world graphs assume ring topology; but instead we're interested in a grid in realistic scenarios
	- the networkx implementation of 2d grid graphs assumes no diagonal edges, whereas we'd like to have the ability to get neighbors from a (sub)set of the full neighborhood (of 8 nodes aside from boundary, corner or missing nodes)
	- since the user has likely already generated their lat/lon grid, we transfer the burden of neighborhood generation to them for now
	- we assume that the grid small-world network's non-local/long-range edges are wired for optimal decentralized efficiency, which coincides with most of the real-world small-world network examples
	- that is, the probability p((u,v)) of a an edge from node u to v is given by p(u,v) ~ d(u,v)^-2, where d(u,v) is the topological shortest path length (i.e. hop length) between u and v *on the grid*
